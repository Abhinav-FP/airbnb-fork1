They'll really take care of you. Amrit knows the best places to find the right things in the city – momos, thongba, friendly pubs, art, meat, traditional things, monasteries – and all the inside information. He's also got an enviable collection of books, art and curios all over the house. And some evenings, lovely Nepali music. And there's so many birds to see from the balconies! (Amrit can ID most of these for you, but don't trust him on the names of stars.) We stayed a week here, but wanted some more. The house is a very short taxi ride from MG Marg, and the taxi stop is right around the corner. If you go during the right season, Amrit's garden will be bursting with fruits and vegetables.

From the pickup at the airport to the check-in, up until the moment of picking up our bags at the end of our stay, everything was absolutely phenomenal. The property itself was beautiful. A wonderful mix of greenery and traditional wooden structure, we could not have asked for a better stay. The rooms were very spacious, and we especially loved the second floor outdoor lounging area! Perfect place to get together with your group before you go back inside your rooms or leave for the day. The location was great, just minutes away from the Chiang Mai Gate, and within all the designated pick-up areas for my adventures. I walked from the gate to the house alone at night and feltvery safe. It's also in a very residential part, slightly away from all the action (but close enough to walk to the action), which was great as we didn't have to deal with any noise at night.I do need to give a shout-out to the breakfast! I opted for breakfast every day of my trip, and it was so delicious I still dream aboutit. The food itself was absolutely phenomenal, and the team that prepared it were such great wholesome people! My elephant sanctuary pickup came a little earlier than expected, and the team made sure I had enough food with me so I wouldn't be hungry (and I was so happy they did because otherwise I would've been so hungry throughout the day).Also another shoutout for Mo and Ton and the team for being the most helpful and wonderful hosts anyone could ask for! Even from before my trip, they helped me with reservations for all of my adventures, and during the trip whenever I had any questions they were so quick to respond, I never feltconfused or lost.  ",

It has a study table and amazing books to read. The hosts live in the same vicinity and are quite reachable. Honestly, you would even feel the need to reach out to them, they are very proactive and understanding. They will offer you chai multiple times and would make sure you are having a comfortable stay. The food here is no fuss home-cooked delicious food. The best part is that the hosts will eat with you. Maya's husband works at a post office in Mukteshwar and he walks half the way there daily. So you can accompany him for a walk till Muksteshwar whenever you want. You need to take a shared cab to a village called 'Shitla' and then walk all the way to Mukteshwar. It's a 4-5kms hike one way. Have some breakfast at Mukteshwar and then he will accompany you back to the homestay after finishing his work. He usually takes an hour to finish his work. Overall, I had an amazing stay at Maya's homestay and would strongly recommend you to book this property.  ",
