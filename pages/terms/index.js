              <h2>1.1 Searching.</h2>
              <p>
                You can search for Host Services by using criteria like the type
                of Host Service, type of listing, travel destination, travel
                dates, and number of guests. You can also use filters to refine
                your search results. Search results are based on their relevance
                to your search and other criteria. Relevance considers factors
                like price, availability, reviews, customer service and
                cancellation history, popularity, previous trips and saved
                Listings, Host requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights),
                and more. Learn more about search results in Section 5.3 and in
                our Help Center.

              <h2>1.2 Booking.</h2>
              <p>
                When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for
                your booking including the Listing price, applicable fees like
                ’s service fee, offline fees, taxes and any other items
                identified during checkout (collectively, “Total Price”). If you
                choose to pay using a currency that differs from the currency
                set by the Host for their Listing, the price displayed to you is
                based on a currency conversion rate determined by us. When you
                receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Host Services
                (a "Reservation") is formed directly between you and the Host.
                In addition to these Terms, you will be subject to, and
                responsible for complying with, all terms of the Reservation,
                including without limitation, the cancellation policy and any
                other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in
                the Listing or during checkout that apply to the Reservation. It
                is your responsibility to read and understand these rules,
                standards, policies, and requirements prior to booking a
                Listing. Be aware that some Hosts work with a co-host or as part
                of a team to provide their Host Services.

                An Accommodation Reservation is a limited license to enter,

              <p>
                In general, if you cancel a Reservation, the amount refunded to
                you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to
                that Reservation. But, in certain situations, other policies may
                take precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you. If
                something outside your control requires you to cancel a
                Reservation, you may be entitled to a partial or full refund
                under our Major Disruptive Events Policy. If the Host cancels,
                or you experience a Reservation Issue (as defined in our
                Rebooking and Refund Policy), you may be entitled to rebooking
                assistance or a partial or full refund under our Rebooking and
                Refund Policy. Different policies apply to certain categories of
                Listings; for example, Experiences Reservations are governed by
                the Experiences Guest Refund Policy. See each Additional Legal
                Term or Policy for details about what is covered, and what
                refund applies in each situation. You may appeal a decision by

              <h2>6.1 Cancellations and Reservation Issues.</h2>
              <p>
                In general, if a Guest cancels a Reservation, the amount paid to
                you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to
                that Reservation. As a host, you should not cancel on a Guest
                without a valid reason under our Major Disruptive Events Policy
                or applicable law. If you cancel on a Guest without such a valid
                reason, we may impose a cancellation fee and other consequences.
                If: (i) a Guest experiences a Reservation Issue (as defined by
                the Rebooking and Refund Policy), (ii) a Major Disruptive Event
                arises, or (iii) a Reservation is canceled under Section 13 of
                these Terms, the amount you are paid will be reduced by the
                amount we refund or otherwise provide to the Guest, and by any
                other reasonable costs we incur as a result of the cancellation.
                If a Guest receives a refund after you have already been paid,
                or the amount of the refund and other costs incurred by
                QuaintSpaces exceeds your payout, QuaintSpaces (via QuaintSpaces
                Payments) may recover that amount from you, including by
                deducting the refund against your future payouts. You agree that
                QuaintSpaces’s Rebooking and Refund Policy, Major Disruptive
                Events Policy, and these Terms preempt the cancellation policy
                you set in situations where they allow for the cancellation of a
                Reservation and/or the issuance of refunds to Guests. If we
                reasonably expect to provide a refund to a Guest under one of
                these policies, we may delay release of any payout for that
                Reservation until a refund decision is made. If you Host an
                Experience please note that the Experience Cancellation Policy,
                Experiences Guest Refund Policy and different cancellation fees
                and consequences apply to your Reservations. See each Policy for

                Damage Claim, the Host may notify QuaintSpaces through the
                Resolution Center under the terms of the Host Damage Protection
                Terms and seek compensation. QuaintSpaces will review the Damage
                Claim and ask the Host to provide any required evidence (e.g.
                through appropriate documents, photos, invoices, or third-party
                experts) which substantiates the Damage Claim and the Damage
                Claim amount. The Guest will be given the opportunity to respond
                and provide any relevant counter evidence. If QuaintSpaces
                determines, under consideration of the evidence provided, the
                Host Damage Protection Terms, and applicable statutory rules on
                the burden of proof that the Guest is responsible for the Damage
                Claim, QuaintSpaces (via QuaintSpaces Payments) will pay out the
                Damage Claim to the Host. If QuaintSpaces pays out the Damage
                Claim to the Host, QuaintSpaces may collect the amount of the
                Damage Claim from the Guest, including by charging the guest’s
                Payment Method up to a maximum amount of $500 USD. QuaintSpaces
                may also pursue claims for recovering Damage Claims amounts,
                including amounts exceeding the maximum amount applicable for
                charging the Guest’s Payment Method, against a Guest using any
                remedies it may have available under applicable law, including
                referral of the matter to a collections agency, and/or pursuit
                of available causes of action and/or claims against a Guest.
                Members may appeal a decision by QuaintSpaces by contacting our
                customer service. As between Members and QuaintSpaces, the
                burden of proof regarding the Damage Claim and the Damage Claim

              We offer you the right to use a platform that enables Members to

              make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract
              directly with each other. QuaintSpaces is not and does not become
              a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship
              between Members. QuaintSpaces is not acting as an agent for any

              agent as provided in the Payments Terms. While we work hard to

              QuaintSpaces Platform (including for fraud prevention, risk
              assessment, investigation and customer support purposes); (ii)
              ensure Members’ compliance with these Terms; (iii) comply with
              applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, law
              enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body;

              other than the one set out on Schedule 1 as being responsible for

                QuaintSpaces is committed to participating in a
                consumer-friendly dispute resolution process. To that end, these
                Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom
                this Section 25 applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly
                with QuaintSpaces’s customer service team (described in
                paragraph 25.3, below), and if necessary (2) a binding
                arbitration in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration
                Agreement. You and QuaintSpaces each retain the right to seek
                resolution of the dispute in small claims court as an
                alternative to arbitration.

              <p>
                At least 30 days prior to initiating an arbitration, you and
                QuaintSpaces each agree to send the other party an
                individualized notice of the dispute in writing (“Pre-Dispute
                Notice") and attempt in good faith to negotiate an informal
                resolution of the individual claim. You must send your
                Pre-Dispute Notice to QuaintSpaces by mailing it to
                QuaintSpaces’s agent for service: CSC Lawyers Incorporating
                Service, 2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N, Sacramento,
                California 95833. QuaintSpaces will send its Pre-Dispute Notice
                to the email address associated with your QuaintSpaces account.
                A Pre-Dispute Notice must include: the date, your name, mailing
                address, your QuaintSpaces username, the email address you used
                to set up your QuaintSpaces account, your signature, a brief
                description of the dispute, and the relief sought. If the
                parties are unable to resolve the dispute within the 30-day
                period, only then may either party commence arbitration by
                filing a written demand for arbitration with the arbitration
                provider designated pursuant to Section 24.6, below. A
                claimant’s Pre-Dispute Notice requirement is a prerequisite to
                any arbitration, and a copy of the Pre-Dispute Notice and
                evidence that it was sent as required by this Section must be
                attached to any arbitration demand.

                second batch, and so forth. The parties shall randomly assign
                each batch a sequential number and arbitrate the batches one at
                a time, in sequential order. While one batch is being
                arbitrated, the arbitration provider shall hold the remainder in
                abeyance unless otherwise agreed by the parties or instructed by
                the arbitration provider. Each batch shall be resolved within
                240 days of the pre-hearing conference for that batch.
                Notwithstanding the forgoing, if any claimant’s demand has not
                been the subject of a pre-hearing conference within 2 years of
                the latest-filed demand in the Mass Action, such claimant may
                elect to pursue the claims asserted in the claimant’s demand in
                court subject to Sections 23 and 25.12 of these Terms.

                25.15 Modifications of Arbitration Rules - Offers of Judgment.
              </h2>
              <p>
                At least ten (10) days before the date set for the arbitration
                hearing, you or QuaintSpaces may serve a written offer of
                judgment on the other party to allow judgment on specified
                terms. If the offer is accepted, the offer with proof of
                acceptance shall be submitted to the arbitration provider, who
                shall issue an award accordingly. If the offer is not accepted
                prior to the arbitration hearing or within thirty (30) days
                after it is made, whichever occurs first, it shall be deemed
                withdrawn and cannot be given as evidence in the arbitration,
                other than with respect to costs (including all fees paid to the
                arbitration provider). If an offer made by one party is not
                accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain
                a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover their
                post-offer costs and shall pay the offering party’s costs
                (including all fees paid to the arbitration provider) from the
                time of the offer.

                unenforceable, such provision will be severed and the remainder

              <h2>25.17 Amendments to Agreement to Arbitrate.</h2>
              <p>
                You and QuaintSpaces acknowledge and agree that the relative
                benefits and efficiencies of arbitration may be lost when 100 or
                more arbitration claims are filed within 180 days which (1)
                involve the same or similarly situated parties; (2) are based on
                the same or similar claims which arise from the same or
                substantially identical transactions, incidents, alleged
                violations or events requiring the determination of the same or
                substantially identical questions of law or fact; and (3)
                involve the same or coordinated counsel for the parties (“Mass
                Action”). Accordingly, you and QuaintSpaces agree to waive the
                right to have any Dispute administered, arbitrated, or resolved
                as part of a Mass Action (though Sections 23 and 25.12 of these
                Terms will continue to apply to the Dispute). In case of a
                dispute, the appointed arbitrator for the first matter
                instituted within a set of claims identified by either party
                shall decide whether those claims are part of a Mass Action. If
                no arbitrator has yet been appointed, an arbitrator shall be
                appointed solely to determine whether claims identified by
                either party are part of a Mass Action. Nothing in this
                provision prevents you or QuaintSpaces from participating in a
                mass settlement of claims.If QuaintSpaces amends this Section 25
                after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any
                subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject the change by
                sending us written notice no later than 30 days of the date the
                change is effective. Your notice must include your name, mailing
                address, the date of the notice, your QuaintSpaces username, the
                email address you used to set up your QuaintSpaces account, your
                signature, and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out
                of the amended Section 25. You must either mail your notice to
                this address: 888 Brannan St, San Francisco, CA 94103, Attn:
                Arbitration Opt-Out, or email the opt-out notice to
                arbitration.opt.out@QuaintSpaces.com. Rejecting a new change,
                however, does not revoke or alter your prior consent to any
                earlier agreements to arbitrate any Dispute between you and
                QuaintSpaces (or your prior consent to any subsequent changes
                thereto), which will remain in effect and enforceable as to any
                Dispute between you and QuaintSpaces.
